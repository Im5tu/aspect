|Name|Description|Docs|
|----------|----------|----------|
|[AwsAccount](/docs/aws/resources/awsaccount/)|The AWS account resource describes the details of the account that a specified resource belongs to.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsaccount/)|
|[AwsEc2Image](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2image/)|The AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs available to you or all of the images available to you. The images available to you include public images, private images that you own, and private images owned by other AWS accounts for which you have explicit launch permissions.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2image/)|
|[AwsEc2Instance](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2instance/)|Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2â€™s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2instance/)|
|[AwsEc2KeyPair](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2keypair/)|A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an EC2 instance.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2keypair/)|
|[AwsEc2Snapshot](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2snapshot/)|Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume. A snapshot takes a copy of the EBS volume and places it in Amazon S3, where it is stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2snapshot/)|
|[AwsEc2Volume](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2volume/)||[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsec2volume/)|
|[AwsElasticIp](/docs/aws/resources/awselasticip/)|An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awselasticip/)|
|[AwsInternetGateway](/docs/aws/resources/awsinternetgateway/)|Internet gateway are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsinternetgateway/)|
|[AwsNatGateway](/docs/aws/resources/awsnatgateway/)|Network address translation (NAT) gateways enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsnatgateway/)|
|[AwsNetworkInterface](/docs/aws/resources/awsnetworkinterface/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsnetworkinterface/)|
|[AwsPrefixList](/docs/aws/resources/awsprefixlist/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsprefixlist/)|
|[AwsReservedInstance](/docs/aws/resources/awsreservedinstance/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsreservedinstance/)|
|[AwsRouteTable](/docs/aws/resources/awsroutetable/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsroutetable/)|
|[AwsSecurityGroup](/docs/aws/resources/awssecuritygroup/)|A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. A security group specifies the actions that are allowed, not the actions that are blocked.|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awssecuritygroup/)|
|[AwsTransitGateway](/docs/aws/resources/awstransitgateway/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awstransitgateway/)|
|[AwsVpcEndpoint](/docs/aws/resources/awsvpcendpoint/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsvpcendpoint/)|
|[AwsVpcPeeringConnection](/docs/aws/resources/awsvpcpeeringconnection/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsvpcpeeringconnection/)|
|[AwsVpcResource](/docs/aws/resources/awsvpcresource/)|Coming soon!|[Goto Docs](/docs/aws/resources/awsvpcresource/)|
