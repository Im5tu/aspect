Depending which cloud resource you intend to use, you may also need to mount credential folders. You can view the relevant configuration for AWS and Azure.\nYou can view the latest tags directly on Docker Hub: here\nIf docker images aren\u0026rsquo;t your thing, you may also either download the pre-compiled binaries for your infrastructure, or build the CLI from source.\nCompiled Binaries For the compiled binaries, head over to the Aspect Releases page and download the pre-compiled binaries for the version that you wish.\nBuilding from source Building from source is the best way if you wish to modify an aspect of Aspect.
