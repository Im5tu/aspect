The search for credentials is in the following order and uses the first available set for the current application:\n A credentials profile with the name specified by a value in environment variable AWS_PROFILE. The default credentials profile. SessionAWSCredentials that are created from the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variables, if they’re all non-empty.

The syntax of the document is largely inspired by Rego, from the Open Policy Agent project. Each policy must have a minimum of two parts: a resource statement and a validate statement block.\nCopy   resource \u0026#34;AwsSecurityGroup\u0026#34; validate { input.Name == \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }    The resource can be any of one of the supported resources, which you can view from running aspect resources. Once set, you have access to a special variable called input which allows you access to the currently evaluating resource in any one of the statement blocks. From here, you will get full type checking during policy evaluation and validation. To view the available properties for a specific resource, follow the documentation link generated by aspect resources.\nStatement Blocks There are three available statement blocks that can be defined in any order: include, exclude, validate. Each one of the statement blocks has the exact same structure:\nCopy   \u0026lt;statement block name\u0026gt; { \u0026lt;statement expression 1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;statement expression 2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;statement expression 3\u0026gt; }    Each statement within a statement block is newline delimited and then logically anded together with the previous statements. If any statement does not successfuly validate against the specified input, then the statement block fails. The effect of a statement block failure depends on the nature of the block. See the Evaluation Logic for more details.\nEach statement expression is always one of the following syntaxes:\nCopy   \u0026lt;statement block name\u0026gt; { input.\u0026lt;accessor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;constant value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;function name\u0026gt;(input.\u0026lt;accessor\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;constant value\u0026gt; [, \u0026lt;constant value N\u0026gt;]) }    Note how the input is always on the left side of the statement expression. The only time this is not strictly required is when there is a function call. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at an example validate block:\nCopy   validate { input.Name == \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; input.Region == \u0026#34;eu-west-1\u0026#34; }    In the above statement block, we have defined two statements:\n input.Name == \u0026quot;Test\u0026quot; - The name of the resource must be equal to Test input.Region == \u0026quot;eu-west-1\u0026quot; - The resource must be in the eu-west-1 region  If either of the above conditions fails, then the corresponding statement block (validate in this example) fails. The following statement blocks are available to be defined in any other:\n   Name Description Required?     validate Validates a cloud resource against the specified criteria. This block must contain at least one statement. Yes   include Include resources that match the specified criteria No   Exclude Exclude resources that match the specified criteria No     Note: Statement blocks cannot be nested inside of one another.\nIf a resource has nested properties, use dot notation to access the properties, for example:\nCopy   validate { input.Account.Id == \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; }    Operators Depending on the type that you are evaluating, the following operators are available to use:\n   Operator Available on Types Description     == String, Boolean, Number The left operand must be equal to the right operand   != String, Boolean, Number The left operand must not be equal to the right operand   \u0026gt; Number The left operand must be greater than the right operand   \u0026gt;= Number The left operand must be greater than or equal to the right operand   \u0026lt; Number The left operand must be less than the right operand   \u0026lt;= Number The left operand must be less than or equal to the right operand     Type System Aspects type system is designed to be as simple as possible to reason about. Therefore, we only have the following types:\n   Name Description Examples     String Represents a peice of text \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo;   Number Represents either an integer or decimal value, which can either be positive or negative. Subject to type coercion -1, 1, 3.142   Boolean Represents a true or false value true, false   Collection\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; Represents a collection of the specified type T, where T is either part of a resource or a KeyValuePair [1,2,3]   KeyValuePair Represents a key and value which both are of type String. Key:Hello, Value:World     Type coercion Aspect performs some very basic type coercion on your behalf. For example, if you want to check if 1 is equal to 1.2, Aspect will correct the data types if it can so that the equality check has a chance to succeed. If the input and the constant expressions can not be coerced, you will recieve a compiler error which will need to be fixed.\nCollections A lot of the resources that area available in Aspect have one or more collections contained inside, often with resources nested underneath them. A good example of this is the [AwsSecurityGroup](/docs/aws/resources/awssecuritygroup/) which has the the IngressRules property, with a nested collection for IPV4Ranges. You can access collections using the following syntax declarations:\nCopy   \u0026lt;statement block name\u0026gt; { input.\u0026lt;collection name\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;access type\u0026gt;] \u0026lt;operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;constant value\u0026gt; }    The \u0026lt;access type\u0026gt; can either be set to ensure that all elements in a collection match the specified syntax, using the input.\u0026lt;collection name\u0026gt;[_] syntax:\nCopy   \u0026lt;statement block name\u0026gt; { input.\u0026lt;collection name\u0026gt;[_] \u0026lt;operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;constant value\u0026gt; }# eg:  validate { input.CollectionOfNumbers[_] \u0026gt; 0 }    ; or they can be set to match any element in the collection using the input.\u0026lt;collection name\u0026gt;[*] syntax:\nCopy   \u0026lt;statement block name\u0026gt; { input.\u0026lt;collection name\u0026gt;[*] \u0026lt;operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;constant value\u0026gt; }# eg:  validate { input.CollectionOfNumbers[*] \u0026gt; 0 }    Take a look at the following examples of how to use collections:\n   input Description     input.Collection[_] == 1 All elements in Collection must be equal to 1   input.Collection[*] == 1 Any element in Collection must be equal to 1   input.Collection[_].SubCollection[*] == 1 All elements in Collection must have a SubCollection element equal to 1   input.Collection[*].SubCollection[_] == 1 Any element in Collection must have all elements in SubCollection equal to 1     Functions When building your policies, you may which to perform certain operations like seeing whether or not a string contains a specific value. Aspect provides you with a set of built in functions to help you. Please see the BuiltIn Functions documentation to see how to use functions properly.\nNote: You cannot use functions with anything other than collection\u0026lt;KeyValuePair\u0026gt; which has limited function support.  Evaluation Logic Now that we know the basics of constructing our policies, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand how the policies are evaluated against cloud resources. The flow is always:\n Discover all resources available Remove any resources that do not validate against the include statement block Remove any resources that do not validate against the exclude statement block Validate the remaining resources against the validate statement block  Or more visually:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at this in more detail with a more real life scenario:\nFor each AwsSecurityGroup in the Product-Group Contoso where there is no tag IsPublic ensure that there are no global ingress rules We would write the policy as follows:\nCopy   resource \u0026#34;AwsSecurityGroup\u0026#34; include { contains(input.Tags, \u0026#34;Product-Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Contoso\u0026#34;) } exclude { contains(input.Tags, \u0026#34;IsPublic\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;) } validate { input.EgressRules[*].IPV4Ranges[*].CIDR != \u0026#34;0.0.0.0/0\u0026#34; }    Now, let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that we have the following resources that were discovered:\n Security Group with an egress rule containing IPV4 CIDR Range 0.0.0.0/0  Tags:  Product-Group: Test     Security Group with an egress rule containing IPV4 CIDR Range 0.0.0.0/0  Tags:  Product-Group: Contoso     Security Group with an egress rule containing IPV4 CIDR Range 0.0.0.0/0  Tags:  Product-Group: Contoso IsPublic: true     Security Group with an egress rule containing IPV4 CIDR Range 0.0.0.0/0  Tags:  Product-Group: Contoso IsPublic: false      Here is how the policy would be evaluated for the above resources:\n The include block would check to see whether each resource has the tag named Product-Group with the value Contoso. Resource #1 does not meet this condition, so it removed from further evaluations. The exclude block would now be processed against resources 2, 3 \u0026amp; 4 as they all match the Product-Group tag. Resource #3 meets the criteria of having the tag IsPublic set to true so it is removed from further evaluations. Resource #4 does have the correct key, but an incorrect value so it remains for the final evaluation block. The validate block is looking for any egress rule with an open CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0 which both the remaining resources (2 \u0026amp; 4) match. These resources are marked as failed.  In quite a few scenarios, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to merge the include and exclude statement expressions for smaller policies, but the flexibility is there should you need something more complex. The rule of thumb is always: how easy is this policy to reason about? will someone new understand this policy if they are new to the system?\n"},{"uri":"https://cloudaspect.app/docs/contributing/add-new-builtin-functions/","title":"Adding New Functions","tags":null,"description":"","content":"Ideally before attempting to add any builtin function, you would raise an issue on the repository so that the proposal can be discussed with the community.\nAssuming that discussion has gone well, here is a list of the changes that need to be made:\n Add the function to BuiltinFunctions.cs Ensure that the function is covered by UnitTests Verify that the parser understands the function signature with tests if not already covered by existing tests Verify that the function generator can built the function as expected with tests Add the relevant Documentation  "},{"uri":"https://cloudaspect.app/docs/cli-commands/aspect-inspect/","title":"aspect inspect","tags":null,"description":"","content":"aspect inspect is a read-eval-print loop (REPL) interface for exploring your cloud resources.

It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. Goto Docs   AwsEc2KeyPair A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an EC2 instance. Goto Docs   AwsEc2Snapshot Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume. A snapshot takes a copy of the EBS volume and places it in Amazon S3, where it is stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones. Goto Docs   AwsEc2Volume An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive. Goto Docs   AwsElasticIp An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance. Goto Docs   AwsInternetGateway Internet gateway are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. Goto Docs   AwsNatGateway Network address translation (NAT) gateways enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
