Depending which cloud resource you intend to use, you may also need to mount credential folders. You can view the relevant configuration for AWS and Azure.\nYou can view the latest tags directly on Docker Hub: here\nIf docker images aren\u0026rsquo;t your thing, you may also either download the pre-compiled binaries for your infrastructure, or build the CLI from source.\nCompiled Binaries For the compiled binaries, head over to the Aspect Releases page and download the pre-compiled binaries for the version that you wish.\nBuilding from source Building from source is the best way if you wish to modify an aspect of Aspect. You will need to clone via one of the following methods:\nClone using SSH git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Im5tu/aspect.git Clone using Github CLI gh repo clone Im5tu/aspect Clone using HTTPS git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Im5tu/aspect.git Building \u0026amp; Running tests In order to build a development build, execute the following command:\ndotnet build In order to run the unit tests, execute:\ndotnet test The solution is designed to take care of any dependencies that are required so that contributors have the best experience in their local development environments.\nShould you need to publish a new version of the CLI for your local testing, execute:\ndotnet publish -r \u0026lt;RID\u0026gt; -c Release You can then run one of the available commands.\n"},{"uri":"https://cloudaspect.app/docs/getting-started/your-first-policy/","title":"Your First Policy","tags":null,"description":"","content":"Coming soon!!\n"},{"uri":"https://cloudaspect.app/docs/contributing/local-development/","title":"Developing Locally","tags":null,"description":"","content":"If you wish to modify an aspect of Aspect, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the source code.
